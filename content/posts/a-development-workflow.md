From my first programming steps, I used a bunch of different IDEs to code, depending on the times and the
programming language used: `Borland C++`, `Code::Blocks` (for C), `Visual Studio` (C, C++), `Matlab IDE`,
`IDLE` (Python native IDE), `Eclipse` (With `PyDev` for `Python`), `Spyder`, `Sublime Text`, `Vim`, `VS Code`, etc.

This is somehow chronological. I lately used `VS Code` because of three main reasons: This is a great software from
Microsoft, I needed to work on Windows (unfortunately) and wanted something great for switching between languages.

Since I recentely came back to MacOS / Linux, I felt the need to restore my "old school" development workflow, with
`vim` and `tmux`. This is what this note is about.

## Vim
A couple of years now I have been using `Vim`. I still feel as a newbie considering the wide options it offers, but also feel
productive with it. I use it in the shell, but also with `Sublime Text` and `VS Code` thanks to the plugins.

`Vim` in the shell with some configuration and plugins is a killer tool for developping in Python.
